                <p class="project-description">
                    I completed this project during the summer of 2016 during my internship at MechDome. This project was about finding a way to optimize graphics on iOS using OpenGL ES 1.1 and 2.0. I was able to take advantage of the "two steps" in the graphics pipeline
                    process to split work into a rendering portion and displaying portion. I delegated the rendering portion to a background thread and only used the main UI thread to draw images when they were ready to be drawn from the render buffer.
                    This approach also featured double buffer rendering to make sure that a frame is always rendering even if another frame is being draw on screen. This reduced graphics work on the main UI thread allows the application to run other more
                    important processes that are only able to run on the main thread, and thereby increased the graphical efficiency of the company's product.

                <p class="project-description">
                    During the 2015 UCSC Hackathon, I participated in a team of four to create Splitr, which is an application that hugely simplifies the task of bill splitting. Splitr uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read in an image of a receipt or bill and
                    parses the text to output the different items on your mobile device. Items can then be assigned to different people to easily calculate the subtotals that each person owes for the bill. We used the open source library Tesseract to
                    integrate OCR functionality in our application.

                <p class="project-description">
                    Gitlet is a local file-based version control system that operates on the same commands that Git typically uses such as add, remove, commit, rebase, etc. This project is essentially a spinoff of Git that I built from scratch. The Git-like commands can
                    be run via terminal just as normal Git commands are usually used. While I do not have the project available on my Github, you may contact me via email if you particularly wish to see the project.
